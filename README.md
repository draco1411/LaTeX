# LaTeX
Contains the boilerplate for several common LaTeX documents I use on the regular 

The file `all.snippets`  contains the contents of math and mla set as an Ultisnips (Vim) shortcut.   
The links are to `make` and `mla` with `<TAB>` as the trigger.  
Note that Ultisnipps placeholders are left intact in this document and thus won't compile until adressed. 


`theJackPack.sty` is kept around as a historical artifact. While handy, the custom commands and fetures are better suited for the header of the document 
or avoided all together. 

pdfLaTeX (TeX Live 2025) is the compiler associated with this code.
