# LaTeX
All my LaTeX related code, *including the .sty file* and many of my homeworks.

**As of 3/29/22, the math that's included is:**
- Proofs from Discrete Math

Things to add in the near future:
- Proofs from Calculus I, II, III 
- Elementaty Proofs from Intermediat Real Anaysis (Ludwig Text)
- Proofs from Linear Algebra

Please note, many teachers use the same homework problems semester after semester, so I've removed the section and problem numbers.
