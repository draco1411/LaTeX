# LaTeX
Contains the boilerplate for several common LaTeX documents I use on the regular 

The file `all.snippets`  contains the contents of gen_math and mla set as an Ultisnips (Vim) shortcut.   
The links are to `make` and `mla` with `<TAB>` as the trigger.  


`theJackPack.sty` is kept around as a historical artifact. While handy, the custom commands and fetures are better suited for the header of the document 
or avoided all together.
